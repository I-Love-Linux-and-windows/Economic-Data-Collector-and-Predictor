# Economic-Data-Collector-and-Predictor
This project is an ambitious project by a single programmer. It collects economic data and works on it.
This code aims to collect financial data from World Bank API and plots it in a line graph.
The user inputs the country they want to check on, the code then requests the API to collect the data on the following things
1. GDP
2. Unemployment Rate
3. Inflation rate
4. Tax Revenue
5. GDP growth rate
6. Population
7. Poverty rate

 After that, it plots in multiple line graphs displayed in separate image files.  I hope you can contribute to the project by adding to the code. I request your help building an engine that aims to  predict future figures on the 7 indicators listed above.
